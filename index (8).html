        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Troy Davidson. I am an english major and am studying to work in education or in art.  I hope to become more involved with BSU as the year goes on, and I plan on getting involved with more organizations with my roommate. Overall, the event was very fun and it was very cool seeing all the different organizations hosted by the black student associations here at UCR. After college, I intend on pursuing a career in education. I also intend to work abroad and am open to working remotely or in person. Additionally, I was able to become closer with my roommate since this event was hosted only a few days after we had moved in together. I hope to become more involved with BSU as the year goes on, and I plan on getting involved with more organizations with my roommate. I hadnâ€™t researched clubs prior to moving into Riverside, so I was able to learn more about clubs that would help me succeed in my academics and meet new people. Afterward, the fraternities came out and talked about what they do and started dancing for the audience. Although Iâ€™m not interested in joining a fraternity at the moment, seeing the communities of people with shared interests was really heartwarming.<br><br>

        I have experience working with classmates and peers proofreading. Currently, I am a freshman attending University of California Riverside. I also have experience with art and have taken art classes throughout high school. On September 26th, my roommate and I attended the Black People Meet hosted by the BSU club at UCR. <br><br>

        This was one of the first club events I had attended this school year and I was really excited to meet other black people at UCR. There were club tables inside the event that allowed me to talk to the African and black organizations at UCR. I hadnâ€™t researched clubs prior to moving into Riverside, so I was able to learn more about clubs that would help me succeed in my academics and meet new people. Afterward, the fraternities came out and talked about what they do and started dancing for the audience. Although Iâ€™m not interested in joining a fraternity at the moment, seeing the communities of people with shared interests was really heartwarming. At the club, I was able to talk to some people in my year that I had previously followed on instagram as well. Before coming to Riverside, I was a little scared that I wouldnâ€™t find people that looked like me, but seeing all the people there showed me that there is a welcoming community at UCR. Additionally, I was able to become closer with my roommate since this event was hosted only a few days after we had moved in together.
